# Recycling

## How is the recycling system in your country? Tell me about recycling system in your country.

In Korea, mamy people are well-practiced of recycling system. Korea has been using a recycling system for 20 years, it is very long time. It was for effective collection of gabage. So we should separate gabage according to their materials such as plastics, glasses, paper and food waste. Each area has specific date to recycle in every week. In my case, my apartment's recycling day is Sunday. Anyway I think the recycling system of Korea is very good.


## How do you recycle? Tell me steps you do as much detail as possible.

Ok. I will explain about my recycling. There are 4 bins in my house. They are for recyclling. One  is for plastics, the others are for papers, glasses and vinyl. I always seperate the gabage accord to its material. There is a specific date in every week for recycling. In my case, Sunday is my apartment's recycling day. On every Sunday, my wife and I always take out the gabage to collecting area. It usually takes 30 minutes, because we can take out it at only one day in a week. 

## Do you have any unforgettable experience about recycling? 

Hmm. I have unforgettable experience about recycling. It was 2 years ago. I was taking out the gabage to collecting area. But the vinyl of food waste is torn. Oh my god. I have blocked a hole with my hands. It was very dirty. The smell was very bad. It was the most terrible memory of recycling. After that, I always use 2 vinyls for food waste.
